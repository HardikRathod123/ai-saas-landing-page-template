# AI SaaS Website Template

A pixel-perfect implementation of an AI SaaS website template, developed with modern web technologies and responsive design principles. This dark-themed template showcases a modern SaaS platform with a focus on artificial intelligence services.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Next.js - React framework for production
- TypeScript - For type safety and better development experience
- Tailwind CSS - For utility-first styling
- Framer Motion - For smooth animations and transitions

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website is carefully crafted to be responsive across three main breakpoints:

- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

Custom width values have been implemented to demonstrate advanced customization capabilities and precise design adherence.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Pixel-perfect implementation of the design template
- Dark theme optimized for AI/SaaS aesthetic
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Fully responsive layout with custom breakpoints
- TypeScript integration for enhanced code reliability
- Modern and clean code architecture
